## Possible-improvements

The Living suggested adding a toggle that changes the scheduler "normal" to "wicked" but The Dead could not be bothered.

A vampire desired the favicons take up the entire button and than changed to the text "Skull Save" when the user hovered over but the vampire never chips in for gas so his request was ignored.
